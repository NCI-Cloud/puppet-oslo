    If you relied on the now removed rabbit_hosts parameters to set rabbit_ha_queues
    to true automatically when you configured multiple hosts you must now explicitly
    set it to true.

    The deprecated options rabbit_host, rabbit_port, rabbit_hosts, rabbit_userid,
    rabbit_password and rabbit_virtual_host in oslo::messaging::rabbit has been
    removed. Please use the transport_url in oslo::messaging::default instead.
